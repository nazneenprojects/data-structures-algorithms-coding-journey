"""
Hereâ€™s the time complexity for each operation in binary search:

Splitting the array in half: This takes O(1) time.
Throwing away one half: This also takes O(1) time.
Calling binary search on the remaining half: Since we're halving the problem size each time, the recurrence is O(logn).
Thus, the overall time complexity of binary search is O(logn).
