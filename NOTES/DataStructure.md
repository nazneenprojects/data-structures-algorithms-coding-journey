#### There are two different types of access: random access and sequential access.
Sequential access means reading the elements one by one, starting with the first element.
- Arrays provide random access.
- Linked lists can only do sequential access. 

 - With an array, you can read a whole section of items. But you can’t do this with a linked list!
 - Arrays are better for reads. 



#### Quick Sort
- Quick sort use D&C
- D&C algorithms are recursive algorithms. There are two steps to solving a problem using D&C:

1. Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case.
2. Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.

According to D&C, with every recursive call, you have to reduce your problem.

To recap, here’s how D&C works:
1. Figure out a simple case as the base case.

2. Figure out how to reduce your problem and get to the base case.
