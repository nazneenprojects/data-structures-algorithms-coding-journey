#### There are two different types of access: random access and sequential access.
Sequential access means reading the elements one by one, starting with the first element.
- Arrays provide random access.
- Linked lists can only do sequential access. 

 - With an array, you can read a whole section of items. But you canâ€™t do this with a linked list!
 - Arrays are better for reads.
